Exercise 0: 
Python is set, Atom.io and Python seem working properly and I could use them. Here what I got,

PS C:\Users\udarici19> python
Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 07:18:10) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> quit ()
PS C:\Users\udarici19> mkdir ilker

Exercise 1:
Having written the same sentences in the example and run it on the terminal, I got the following:
PS C:\Users\udarici19\ilker> python ex1.py
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
PS C:\Users\udarici19\ilker>

Exercise 2: 
This exercise focuses on the "#" sign, which ignores the text after it and had no problem with it

PS C:\Users\udarici19> cd github
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex2.py
I could have done like this.
This will run.
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github>
