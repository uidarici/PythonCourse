Exercise 0: 
Python is set, Atom.io and Python seem working properly and I could use them. Here what I got,

PS C:\Users\udarici19> python
Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 07:18:10) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32

PS C:\Users\udarici19\ilker>

Exercise 1:

Having written the same sentences in the example and run it on the terminal, I got the following:
PS C:\Users\udarici19\ilker> python ex1.py
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
PS C:\Users\udarici19\ilker>

Exercise 2: 

This exercise focuses on the "#" sign, which ignores the text after it and had no problem with it

PS C:\Users\udarici19> cd github
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex2.py
I could have done like this.
This will run.
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github>

Exercise 3:

PS C:\Users\udarici19> cd github
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex3.py
I will now count my chickens:
Hens 30.0
Roosters 97
Now I will count the eggs
6.75
Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?
False
 What is 3 + 2? 5
What is 5-7? -2
Oh, that's why it's False.
How about some more.
Is it greater? True
Is it greater or equal? True
Is it less or equal? False

Exercise 4: Variables and Names

cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

print ("There are", cars, "cars available.")
print ("There are only", drivers, "drivers available.")
print ("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.")
print ("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.")
print ("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.")
print ("We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.")


PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex4.py
There are 100 cars available.
There are only 30 drivers available.
There will be 70 empty cars today.
We can transport 120.0 people today.
We have 90 to carpool today.
We need to put about 3.0 in each car.
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github>

Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing

my_name = 'U. Ilker Darıcı'
my_age = 240 # not a lie
my_height = 123 # inches
my_weight = 193 # lbs
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_teeth = 'Black'
my_hair = 'Pink'

print (f"Let's talk about {my_name}.")
print (f"He's {my_height} inches tall.")
print (f"He's {my_weight} pounds heavy.")
print ("Actually that's not too heavy.")
print (f"He's got {my_eyes} eyes and {my_hair} hair.")
print (f"His teeth are usually {my_teeth} depending on the coffee.")

total = my_age + my_height + my_weight
print (f"If I add {my_age}, {my_height}, and {my_weight}, I get {total}.")

PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex5.py
Let's talk about U. Ilker Darıcı.
He's 123 inches tall.
He's 193 pounds heavy.
Actually that's not too heavy.
He's got Blue eyes and Pink hair.
His teeth are usually Black depending on the coffee.
If I add 240, 123, and 193, I get 556.

Question_1:  couldn't get what is different from ex5 in this example. For What "f" is used?

Exercise 6: Strings and Text

types_of_people = 10
x = f"There are {types_of_people} types of people."

binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = f"Those who know {binary} and those who {do_not}."

print (x)
print (y)

print (f"I said: {x}")
print (f"I also said: '{y}'")

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}"

print (joke_evaluation.format(hilarious) )

w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

print (w + e)

PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex6.py
There are 10 types of people.
Those who know binary and those who don't.
I said: There are 10 types of people.
I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'
Isn't that joke so funny?! False
This is the left side of...a string with a right side.

Exercise 7: More Printing

print ("Mary had a little lam.")
print ("Its fleece was white as {}.".format ('snow'))
print ("And everywhere that Mary went.")
print ("." * 10)

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

print (end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end = ' ')
print (end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)

PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex7.py
Mary had a little lam.
Its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.
..........
Cheese Burger

Exercise 8: Printing 

formatter = "{} {} {} {}"

print (formatter.format(1, 2, 3, 4))
print (formatter.format("one", "two", "three", "four"))
print (formatter.format(True, False, False, True))
print (formatter.format(formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter))
print (formatter.format("Seheryeli", "Bizim ele gidersen", "Nazlı yare küstüğümü", "Söyleme."))
