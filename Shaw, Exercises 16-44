***Exercise 16: Reading and Writin Files

from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print(f"We're going to erase {filename}.")
print("If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).")
print("If you do want that, hit RETURN")

input("?")

print("Opening the file...")
target = open(filename, 'w')

print("Truncating the file. Goodbye!")
target.truncate()

print("Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.")

line1 = input("line 1: ")
line2 = input("line 2: ")
line3 = input("line 3: ")

print("I'm going to write these to the file.")

target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print("And finally, we close it.")
target.close()

PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex16.py test.txt
We're going to erase test.txt.
If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).
If you do want that, hit RETURN
?
Opening the file...
Truncating the file. Goodbye!
Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.
line 1: merhaba
line 2: dÃ¼nya
line 3: ilker geldi
I'm going to write these to the file.
And finally, we close it.

***Exercise 17: More Files

Using import is a way to get tons of free code other better (well, usually) programmers have written so you do not have to write it. 

from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print(f"Cpoying from {from_file} to {to_file}")

in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()

print(f"The input file is {len(indata)} bytes long")

print(f"Does the output file exists? {exists(to_file)}")
print("Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort")
input()

out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
out_file.write(indata)

print("Alrigt, all done.")

out_file.close()
in_file.close()

PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> echo "This is a test file." > test.txt
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> cat test.txt
This is a test file.
PS C:\Users\udarici19\github> python ex17.py test.txt new_file.txt
Cpoying from test.txt to new_file.txt
The input file is 46 bytes long
Does the output file exists? False
Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort

Alrigt, all done.
